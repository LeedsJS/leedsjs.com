Sarah Ashworth is a technical recuriter for Conex Europe. In her own words:

"I predominantly specialize in Open Source recruitment, covering all areas within LAMP, PHP/JavaScript including Developers, Testers/Business Analysts, and PMs. I also cover all Front End Dev/UI roles as well.

I have been part of CONEX for 5 years and I like to think I am not a typical recruiter and try to be more a normal human being! I have been an active member in the OpenSource Developer community for the last two years.

CONEX currently sponsors [LeedsPHP](http://www.twitter.com/leedsphp), [LiverpoolJS](http://www.twitter.com/liverpooljsug) as well as being founder members of [NodeUpNorth](http://twitter.com/nodeupnorth). "
