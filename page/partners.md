## Partners
NodeUpNorth or now the new LeedsJS is made possible by our partners all of whom contribute the necessary resources to make our events happen. Below is a short intro to each of them. We are sad to see some go from last year such as First 10 who were a fantastic contributor to really helping get NodeUpNorth going.

###CONEX Europe
Conex provide our drinks/food!

Conex Europe have offices based in Yorkshire and London and we are a specialist IT Recruitment Company, providing both contract and permanent IT professionals.

We don’t diversify in what we do, nor do we want to - we stick to what we do best. As a company, we cover the full IT Software Development LifeCycle from Developers, Testers, Architects, PMs, Application and Infrastructure. .

We have been an active member in the OpenSource Developer community for the last two years, helping raise profile to these great User Groups/events held and set up by Developers.
CONEX Europe currently sponsor LeedsPHP ([@leedsphp](http://www.twitter.com/leedsphp)), LiverpoolJSUG ([@LiverpoolJSUG](http://www.twitter.com/liverpooljsug)) and also part of the team to help form this great group, NodeUpNorth merging with LeedsJs, @leedsjs.

The CONEX team also attend the larger networking events, including being part of PHPNW conference for the last two years to help increase our technical knowledge in what we specifically recruit for, building  much more trustworthy & solid relationships with our clients & candidates.

It’s fantastic for us to be part of the OpenSource Development community when we can, helping raise awareness of these local User groups and being able to learn direct from you, as Developers!

There is usually two of us at the event, myself (Sarah) and my colleague Katie. We are typcially they only girls there (sometimes! :-) ) so by all means come say hello.

###Blooie - our new organiser!

Blooie is simple, affordable software for people who want to increase their conversions online. Chris Manson, one of the co founders of Blooie has come on board to help "relaunch" NodeUpNorth into LeedsJS and is doing a sterling job so far!

Thank you.

###First 10 - sorry to see you go!

We are very sorry to see First 10 leave us - after a great year working together with Mark. First 10 were a fantastic sponsor, helping organise and fund our meetings (with glorious pizza and prizes!). So thank you for all your support this last year and we hope to see you still popping down to keep an eye on us.
