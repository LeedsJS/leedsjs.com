###The When
NodeUpNorth meets on the last Wednesday of every  month from 7pm.

###The Format
We're open to ideas but our usual format is informal drinks and food followed by a presentation or workshop on a Node related subject. Following this there are prize draws then an opportunity to chat and network in a developer friendly environment.

###The Where
In 2015 our meetings will be predominently held at the Adelphi Pub, on Hunslet Road. Great food and Beer/Ales. We usually meet in the upstairs bar/area, where we have the projector. 


####Location
3-5 Hunslet Road, 
Leeds
LS10 1JQ
