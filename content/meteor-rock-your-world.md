####February 26th at Salem Chapel, Leeds

February's NodeUpNorth meeting explores Meteor, the ambitious open source framework that simply sits atop of Node. Or is that all it is?

In this month's presentation, Bob Davies will be offering his thoughts on Meteor.

###Synopsis

Meteor is not **JUST** a platform built over Node, used to make reactive data-driven applications simpler, better, and faster than ever; though it is that for sure. Meteor is a different approach to how an application should be built, how developers **AND** users should interact with it, and how they should interact with each other...

Meteor embraces all things Node, and then some. Meteor Intro/Tech to start, and a discussion of some of the unique challenges and opportunities Meteor presents. Want to know if Meteor is for you? Come and find out :)

###Our Speaker

####Bob Davies (IndieSpring/Imba Software)
I'm a javascript developer with a generalist background (done a bit of everything over the last ~15 years). I've been using Node for a couple of years and playing with Meteor for the last year or so.

I've mostly built small/fun-projects and tech-demos with Meteor to see what it can do, though finishing up dev stage on my latest platform at the moment: Undostagram. I've learned a bit about how to use Meteor to get things done for real, which comes with its own issues when  you're building a platform re-usable for many different end-products.

I have a corporate background in .Net, plenty of PHP and Java too, but have been using Javascript as my main language on various platforms for 5-6 years, starting with browser plugins, XUL/air/etc, into APIs and
games on top of Node.
