##June 25th, Salem Chapel, Leeds
For June's NodeUpNorth we're joined by [Robbie Pallas](http://www.twitter.com/robbiepallas), a full stack and mobile development contractor.

In this month's talk Robbie will be talking MEAN. He'll provide a brief overview of the MEAN stack components explaining how they fit together.

He'll then move on to cover some of the tools that have emerged to support the stack.

The session will also include a demo of [MEAN.JS](http://meanjs.org) and [MEAN.io](http://mean.io) with a discussion about how tools like this can help speed up the development process.

And as if that weren't enough Robbie will round it all up with a demo of some code from a MEAN stack project he's worked on recently to give an idea of what a larger MEAN stack application looks like.
