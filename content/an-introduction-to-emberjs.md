Why a NodeJS developer should sit up and take notice.

##July 30th, Salem Chapel, Leeds
###Why a NodeJS developer should sit up and take notice.

For our final meetup before a short summer break and our Autumn programme of events we'll be joined once more by [Chris Manson](http://www.twitter.com/real_ate), CTO of [Bloo.ie](http://bloo.ie) a full stack real time support chat solution.

Chris has made full stack JavaScript the core of his company's solutions and has some firm opinions on [EmberJS](http://www.emberjs.com). Chris also kindly led our inaugral Node Hack Session so is well placed to provide his views on this opinionated library.

In brief Chris's talk will cover:

- Introduction to the concepts of EmberJS
- How to get up to speed quickly
- Tips on improving your Ember workflow with Node
- Demos of cool use cases for Ember made possible with Node
- Some live coding as well - (closest we could get to walking on fire with fire regs.)



As ever there will be food, drink and prizes and a fantastic community of like minded developers all keen to learn more about Node.js.

Please note the group is intended for developers looking to expand their knowledge in a recruiter free zone only so whilst interest from recruitment consultants is nice we have a no recruiters policy.
