###Synopsis
Mark will examine the basics of gaming with Node along with considerations as the complexity of your games increase.

His session will cover:

* Introduction to HTML5 canvas
* Basic shapes and moving them with user input
* Demo-ing some canvas experiments
* Adding extra users to interact on the canvas
* Managing the flow with Node.js and socket.io (basic pong game)
* Calculations and rendering shapes
* Demo-ing a more advanced multiplayer game (2+ people space shooter) and some of the gotcha's encountered therein
* Introduction to more advanced systems like webGL and [three.js](http://threejs.org)
* Where you can go from 2d games.
* Questions
