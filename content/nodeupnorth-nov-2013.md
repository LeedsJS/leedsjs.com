## Using Node to crawl the web.
For our final meeting of 2013 we'll be joined by Mark Ibbotson. Mark will be showing us how Node.js can be used to crawl the web for various purposes.

Mark's talk will touch on:

* Web crawling introduction
* Types of crawler & practices
* Page readers
* Power of Node's networking capabilities
* Crawling search engines
* Look at modules like Cheerio & Request

Mark's enlightening talk promises to be a mix of talk and demonstration. So why not join us upstairs at the Brewery Tap, Leeds from 7pm?

As ever there will be food, drink and prizes and a fantastic community of like minded developers all keen to learn more about Node.js

You can join the group over on Meetup.org via our [event page](http://www.meetup.com/NodeUpNorth/events/145667932/).
