####January 29th at Salem Chapel, Leeds
To kick start 2014 we're joined by [Glen Mailer](uk.linkedin.com/pub/glen-mailer/29/750/958) who will provide a practical introduction to how and why you should be using a real message queue - at any scale. We'll have a short introduction to message queue concepts and architecture using [AMQP](http://www.amqp.org/) and [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/), exploring why this is helpful and what queues can be used for.

We'll then have a workshop session where attendees can write queue consumers and publishers against a sample server, giving you a taste of working with a system like this.

Ideally attendees should arrive with [Node.js 0.10.x](http://nodejs.org/download/ "Download NodeJs") pre-installed, "***npm install amqp***" will also save us a bit of setup time and bandwidth.

Glen's session promises to be a mix of talk and hands-on coding workshop. So why not join us at our new sponsor's (aql) venue in the historic Salem Chapel which is opposite The Tetley from 7pm?

As ever there will be food, drink and prizes and a fantastic community of like minded developers all keen to learn more about Node.js
