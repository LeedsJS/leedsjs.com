Firstly, hi from Sarah & Mark, we hope you're all well, rested and all set for a fascinating and challenging 2014. Since our last meeting of 2013, back in November, we've been hard at work, behind the scenes, to ensure 2014 is a fantastic year for NodeUpNorth.

As you'll know if you attended any of our meetings last year we were looked after by The Brewery Tap. As we progressed through the year it was becoming clear that whilst the beer was great, the facilities weren't able to keep pace with what we needed.

So following the last meeting of the year we decided to try and source somewhere that befitted the group and started to search high and low for a reasonably central venue that could provide both drinks and food and, just as importantly, sufficently capable A/V and tech provision (i.e. a working internet connection!)

Having shortlisted a number of venues we whittled it down to two and we're pleased to announce we also picked up a new sponsor in the process.

So, with immediate effect, all future meetings in 2014 will be held at the fabulous Salem Chapel on Hunslet Road. This atmospheric building is being kindly provided by our new sponsor, [aql](http://www.aql.com/ "aql - data and telephony services.").

##Location
Salem Chapel is on Hunslet Road and is a 1 minute walk from the Adelphi Pub, opposite the refurbished Tetley Building. The room has its own private bar and we'll be undisturbed for our meetings. For those that like to hang around and talk after the main part of the meeting we'll have use of the venue until approx. 10pm when we'll relocate to the Adelphi.

The full address is:
aql
11-15 Hunslet Road
LEEDS
LS10 1JQ

For January's meeting you'll need to enter by the door closest to the Tetley building. From Feb onwards it will be the door nearest the Adelphi.

As aql's premises house a data centre we'll be providing a guest list to aql ahead of the event so it will help massively if you pre-register on the [meetup page](http://meetup.org/NodeUpNorth "Our meetup events page"). This will also allow us to ensure there's enough delicious food from [Salt's deli](http://www.saltscatering.co.uk/) to feed us all.

##Facilities
We have a great meeting room with private bar (offering a changing rota of draught and bottled beers and lagers (soft drinks also available for designated drivers and de-toxers).

In addition, the room has a large screen HDTV and as aql provide data and telephony services there's a very reliable and seriously quick wifi connection so online, realtime demos should no longer be an issue. (aql are the people behind the blue #scifiwifi phone boxes in Leeds city centre).

So, same agenda, interesting talk/demo, free food and drink, prizes and a chance to get together with peers also interested in Node.js in a recruiter free zone.

I'm sure you'll join us in welcoming aql on board as a sponsor of our growing group. See you all on the [Wednesday the 29th](http://www.meetup.com/NodeUpNorth/events/149257382/ "Our next meeting - Message Queues for Everyone")!
