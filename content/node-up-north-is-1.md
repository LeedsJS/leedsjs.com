###UPDATE
Dan has provided [his talk slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YyGFtkaaQZqrmnLvnYe-LTibFAzCoXFDPC1lhkBJbZk/edit#slide=id.p).

And here are Chris's [talk slides](http://slides.com/real_ate/express-autoroute-why-you-should-never-write-any-code).
####April 30th at Salem Chapel, Leeds

April's NodeUpNorth marks our first birthday...

So this month we have two great speakers and more prizes, lots of food and drink, you'd be mad to miss out.

###Dan Spencer
Our first speaker is Dan Spencer who will be talking to us about [TypeScript]. Dan will cover:

* The basics of TypeScript

* How he uses it in a Node environment

* Why it's a valuable tool for Node applications

Dan ([@dan_spencer](http://www.twitter.com/dan_spencer)) is a Leeds based PHP & JS developer. Check out his [Github](https://github.com/danrspencer)

###Chris Manson
And as if that wasn't enough we're also joined by Chris Manson ([@real_ate](http://www.twitter.com/real_ate)), CTO of startup [Bloo.ie](http://bloo.ie). Bloo.ie are a startup that build exclusively in full stack Javascript. Chris will talk to us about Express Autoroute: 2 helper npm modules that Bloo.ie have contributed for making Express routes a breeze.  Chris is a confirmed fan of [EmberJS](http://www.emberjs.com).

Chris will talk about why he and his team created Express Autoroute and how it can be used to clean up your Express applications.

He will also cover Bloo.ie's preference for Convention over Configuration and why they find highly opinionated libraries really helps development in any size team.
