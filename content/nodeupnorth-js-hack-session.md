On Wednesday 14th May First 10 Digital & Bloo.ie will be hosting the inaugural NodeUpNorth JS Hack Session.

Want to get started in full stack JavaScript development? Started a project but got stuck? Need a hand with getting something over the line? For the first time, NodeUpNorth in association with [Bloo.ie](http://bloo.ie) and [First 10](http://www.first10.co.uk) are hosting a free to attend session where you can get the help you need.

We'll be providing food and refreshments to accompany the coding. So book on and come armed with questions and ideas!
