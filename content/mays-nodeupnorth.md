##"Should it?": Why we have got this BDD thing wrong - and how to do it right!
####May 28th at Salem Chapel, Leeds
For May's NodeUpNorth we welcome [Richard McIntyre](https://www.twitter.com/mackstar), a freelance developer with a wide range of programming language skills. Richard joins us to share and discuss a tool he had a hand in creating. Over to Richard for a quick overview of this evening's content:

"At a major broadcaster where I have been working we have invested heavily in BDD. Dev's are trained in it, the business promotes it, time is given to us to be able to focus on it. Even so we have made many mistakes. Our Cucumber builds can take hours, tests get forgotten are hard to maintain and break often.

But still having well documented feature files that show visibility of test coverage is still important. We solved this by creating our own BDD tool called "Should It?"

Built on Node.JS that will work with any technology and programming language you have written your tests in."
