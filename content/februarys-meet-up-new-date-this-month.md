Hello!

Chris is crazy busy organising the wonderful Hack he will be hosting to you this month and some Live Demos, so I wanted to  point out that this month, we have a change to usual our usual LeedsJS program!!

First of all, this months meet-up isn't on the last Wednesday of the month, so please double check the date in case you have skimmed past that - @leedsjs on Twitter.

So, the plan this month is a Hack session and Live Demos!
If you have a project you have been working on and want a few extra pairs of eyes, then come down and see us. If you have a project you want to show off to like minded individuals, well we hope to see you there.

That is not to say anyone without projects can't come, please do! And we will have a few people on hand to teach you a thing or two about a few different technologies.
Just remember to bring a laptop so you will get the most out of this meetup.

Anyone who wants to give a demo, remember we have the Slack group to chat to Chris on hand there, (his username is real_ate), and if you haven't joined the Slack group yet.... DO SO!!! Message Chris to learn how.

We hope to see you all there,
