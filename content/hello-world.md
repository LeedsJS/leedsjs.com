##NodeUpNorth has a new home!

Well it took a wee while and for [Ghost](http://ghost.org) to launch but NodeUpNorth has a new permanent home and it's running on [Node.js!](http://www.nodejs.org)

### So what can you expect?

We'll endeavour to expand upon what lives on the [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.org/NodeUpNorth) but also:

* Coverage of new releases of Node.js & associated libraries
* Comparisons of similar things (e.g. CouchDB vs MongoDB)
* Node related events
* Tutorials & code snippets
* Book reviews
* Guest blogs on matters Node related

But it's a group that belongs to its membership so what do you want to see here?
